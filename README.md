Titanic Machine Learning Project Kaggle

Introduction

On April 15, 1912, the biggest tragedy in shipwreck history happened when MS Titanic capsized after hitting an Iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean. It was carrying 2224 passengers who belonged to different strata of the society. Out of these, 1502 people including passengers and crew members were killed. It was a well-known fact that women and children and mostly people traveling in the upper classes of the ship had the highest survival. The aim of this machine learning project was to test the initial hypothesis that mostly women, children and upper-class passengers survived and to see any possible relations between other features of the passengers and their survival.

FLOW OF ANALYSIS

--Importing the necessary libraries

--Importing the dataset

--Feature Matrix and Target Variable Description

--Initial data exploration

--Combining training set and test set for data cleaning

--Imputing missing values

--Creating new features by manipulating existing independent features.

--Splitting the dataset back into train and test set

--Initial Data visualization with the clean dataset

--Applying Linear and Non- Linear Classifiers algorithms with Hyperparameter tuning

--Run 10-fold cross validation on the training set and recording the mean prediction accuracy, overall confusion matrix, Sensitivity and specificity for each model.

--Choosing the best model

--Running the best model on the Test Set

--Scope of further studies
